# Python-login-app
My second attempt at simple Python login system, with basic password encryption and encrypted user credentials being saved in a JSON file.

## Features:
- sign up with a user and password
- Login authenticated using encrypted password
- stores data in a JSON file
- Tkinter GUI
- error messages for invalid login attempts or weak passwords

## Tools i used
 - Python 3
 - Tkinter for the GUI
 - JSON for data storage and recall
 - Basic encryption algorithm

Can be ran **downloading this repository** or **cloning it**, and running the `main.py` file, ensure **Python 3** is installed.
